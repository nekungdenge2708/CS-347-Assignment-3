I pledge my honor that I have abided by the stsvens honor system.


Start Apache to run PHP files
Have mySQL installed and configured.

Instructions for building the system:
- First import the SQL file 
- Include.php is a script that holds the database credentials. Update this with your host name, user name, pw, and your database name.
- Open the included HTML file
- Run and try testing



Unit Testing (In this case manual testing)
- The only two working tags currently are “mexican” and “breakfast food”. By entering these into the search and submitting, you will return quesadillas and pancakes respectively.
- Entering anything other than the above tags will return no results.
- Entering the name of any food will also return it as a result. The foods are “quesadillas” and “pancakes”.

Subsections consist of:
- the database
	Done in PHP with two data entries as examples for testing
- the calendar
	needs to be implemented. HTML code included but not yet connected to database.
- The name search
- The tag search


We weren't sure how to upload all the files through git so we submitted the files together in a ZIP. sorry about that.
